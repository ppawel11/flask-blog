This is Flask Blog which I am writing following Corey Schafer's tutorial on youtube.

For now you may create an user account, log in and add posts. You may also edit or delete posts you have added
and edit your account details (username, email and profile picture).

Before starting an app you need to:
1. Install necessary packages using pip (preferably in a virtualenv): : **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**
2. Create database locally. To do so run: **python3 create_db.py**

After that you can start Flask Blog with: **python3 run.py**

Enjoy :)

Features I would like to add in the future:
- categories of posts
- adding pictures to posts
- infinity scroll
